                        <h3>9 Steps to Improve Doctor-Patient Communication</h3>
                        <h4>Marc Lefton</h4>
                        <h5>August 31, 2016</h5>
                        <p>
                            Doctor-Patient communication is a fundamental part of the medical practice. If it is done well, it can have a real therapeutic effect in the patient. The way a doctor delivers the information to his/her patients is as important as the information being delivered. Patients that effectively understand their doctors can acknowledge their health issues, understand the risk and benefits of the treatments available, follow their treatment schedules, and have a better overall behavior.</p>
                        <br>
                        <ol type="1" class="blog-list">
                            <li class="li-blog">Evaluate Patient’s Knowledge</li>
                            <p>Learn what your patient already knows before providing any sensible information. Usually, other doctors or healthcare specialists have already given information to the patient, or the patient has looked for information in non-reliable sources. This can improve the perception of the patient but can also cause confusion when you introduce new information.</p>

                            <br>

                            <li class="li-blog">Find out What Your Patient Wants to Know</li>
                            <p>Patients with the same diagnosis not always want the information about their condition or treatment to be offered in the same level of detail. Doctors must first evaluate if the patient wants additional information, and if he or she will be able to comprehend it. The level of need will be identified as the doctor synthesizes and delivers the information in a clear and understandable way and the discussion unfolds.</p>
                            <p>When presenting the information, the doctor must describe the risk and benefits of procedures or treatments, and then allow the patient to decide the amount of additional information that he or she wants. This may require strategic silences, direct questions, and constant verification that every piece of information is being understood.</p>

                            <br>

                            <li class="li-blog">Be As Empathetic as Possible</li>
                            <p>Doctors should develop empathy in order to easily recognize their patients’ indirectly expressed emotions. Once you recognize such emotions, they need to be acknowledged and the doctor should further explore them during the doctor-patient meeting. Doctors cannot ignore or minimize patient feelings by focusing on ‘real’ symptoms. On the contrary, by acknowledging patients’ expressed emotions, their satisfaction will be enhanced and the doctor will not be seen as uncaring.</p>

                            <br>

                            <li class="li-blog">Slow Down and Pause</li>
                            <p>In order to allow patients the required time to understand new information, doctors must provide it in a thoughtful and slow manner. Doctors can also include frequent pauses and reinforce silence with body language to allow more time. Delivering information slowly with appropriate pauses allows patients time to formulate questions, allowing doctors to provide more pieces of targeted information to the patient.</p>

                            <br>

                            <li class="li-blog">Keep the Information Short and Simple</li>
                            <p>Doctors must avoid long monologues that could bore, confuse, or scare the patient. Instead, the doctor should try to only make short statements and simple explanations. Tailoring the information to match the desired level improves comprehension and limits the emotional distress that may be caused to the patient. Doctors can ask their patients whether they have any question or not to check if they are understanding and promote dialogue. It is also recommended to avoid medical jargon whenever possible, especially with elderly patients.</p>

                            <br>

                            <li class="li-blog">Be Truthful and Avoid Euphemisms</li>
                            <p>As a rule, it is always better to be truthful. Additionally, doctors should not minimize the impact of what they say, euphemisms can turn out to be misleading and create confusion. Using “left us” or “gone” can be misinterpreted by anxious family members. Doctors should instead use D-words (dead, died, dying, etc.) to better communicate the situation and reduce confusion.</p>

                            <br>

                            <li class="li-blog">Be Hopeful Even After Telling the Truth</li>
                            <p>Even though it is better to tell the truth, there is an important therapeutic value in transmitting hope, particularly in situations that might look hopeless. In the context of imminent death, hope can be transmitted to the family by claiming the treatment is effective at reducing pain and discomfort. So even if a doctor must deliver a grim prognosis to a patient or his/her family, there is real value in being able to promise minimal suffering and comfort.</p>

                            <br>

                            <li class="li-blog">Watch the Patient’s Face Expressions and Body Language</li>
                            <p>An important part of the exchange between a patient and a doctor happens through nonverbal communication. Both the patient and the doctor will remember the facial expressions and body language of each other for longer than any spoken words. These are good indications of anxiety, worry, or sadness. Doctors that react with appropriate concern will have a better impact in the patient’s illness. An attentive doctor has more satisfied patients.</p>

                            <br>

                            <li class="li-blog">Prepare Yourself for the Reaction</li>
                            <p>Patients have varied reactions to communications from the doctor, and most doctors easily develop a sense for the different styles of patients. Either way, it is important to be prepared when responding to any reaction from a patient. First of all, doctors must recognize the response and allow enough time for a complete display of the patient’s emotions. Sometimes the doctor must only listen quietly and attentively to what the patient says, or encourage the patient to express his/her emotions. Body language is crucial for the doctor in order to convey empathic concern.</p>
                            <p>The Doctor-Patient communication is not over after the diagnosis, tests, and treatments. This is just the beginning for the patient, the news is sinking in and being slowly processed and digested.</p>

                        <h3>Benefits and Advantages of Patient Engagement</h3>
                        <h4>Marc Lefton</h4>
                        <h5>August 31, 2016</h5>
                        <p>

                            Patient engagement is an extensive concept that involves patient activation, which is the willingness and ability of patients to manage their own healthcare, and actions that promote a positive patient behavior, such as convincing patients to exercise regularly or getting preventive care. Patient engagement can achieve lower costs, better patient care, and improved health outcomes; also known as the “triple aim” of healthcare.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>Evidence shows that patients that are actively involved with their healthcare get better results and lower costs. Thus, numerous private and public health care organizations are applying strategies and resources to have a better engagement with their patients, such as providing them with more information about their diseases or conditions and giving them the opportunity to choose the medical treatment they prefer.</p>

                        <p>A deeper engagement between patients and doctors contributes to better health outcomes, and current technology can support this level of engagement. Patients also want to be a part of the decision-making process of their own healthcare, something that wouldn’t be possible if there isn’t a minimum level of engagement.</p>

                        <ol type="1" class="blog-list">
                            <li class="li-blog">Proper Use of Patient Engagement</li>
                            <p>Many in the healthcare industry use the “patient engagement” term to refer to many things, from online patient portals to the ability to communicate easily with patients. However, the definition of ‘patient engagement’ goes far beyond. It’s not the technology available what makes a good patient engagement, it’s the proper use that patients and doctors make of it.</p>

                            <p>Software solutions to improve patient engagement are no longer something that’s “good to have,” they are now an essential part in medical practice, academia, and government areas. They are even required in order to comply with major health reforms such as the Meaningful Use Stages, the Accountable Care Organizations (ACOs), and the Patient-Centered Medical Home (PCMH).</p>

                            <p>Healthcare organizations and specialists that apply patient engagement can improve patient satisfaction and their own productivity. There is also a clear connection between patient engagement and better clinical outcomes.</p>

                            <br>

                            <li class="li-blog">Main Advantages of Patient Engagement</li>
                            <p>There are three main advantages of having a patient engagement, and they are the most evident reasons that explain why a deeper engagement system is vital for healthcare organizations.</p>

                            <ul class="blog-ul">
                                <li class="li-blog">Patient engagement is required to achieve the triple aim of healthcare</li>
                                <p>Reducing the cost of healthcare, improving the patient experience, and obtaining better results can only be achieved through a better engagement with patients. Patients deeply involved with their healthcare incur in lower costs and have better health outcomes. In fact, people pay more attention to their medical care when they can easily access their health information online.</p>

                                <li class="li-blog">Patient engagement promotes patient loyalty, lowers costs, and improves efficiency</li>
                                <p>A deeper patient engagement make good business sense for healthcare practices. Patients want easy request for prescription refills, secure messaging with healthcare providers or healthcare specialists, appointment scheduling, online bill paying, and online access to their medical records. And since patients are growing aware of healthcare costs, they now demand more conveniences and sophisticated solutions than before. If they are not satisfied, they will just change their provider.</p>

                                <p>Patient engagement increases healthcare specialists’ efficiency, decreases telephone volume and all the costs associated with indirect and direct labor, phone calls, mailing laboratory tests, scheduling appointments, processing payments, and all issues that can easily be managed through online connectivity. Lower costs allow healthcare providers to increase their productive and be more competitive in the market.</p>

                                <li class="li-blog">Patient engagement is needed to meet quality standards in healthcare</li>
                                <p>Healthcare reform initiatives such as Accountable Care Organizations (ACOs), Patient-Centered Medical Home model (PCMH), and the Meaningful Use stages have patient engagement as their ultimate goal. The stage 1 of Meaningful Use in 2011 was aimed at data capture and sharing, stage 2 in 2014 was intended to advance clinical processes, and the stage 3 in 2016 is meant to improve outcomes.</p>
                                <p>In order to comply with these quality standards, healthcare organizations had to implement electronic communication with their patients, and other measures that required technology and online connectivity, to achieve a deeper engagement with them. The goal is to encourage empowered and informed patients.</p>
                                <p>Both private and public insurance payers are shifting to reimbursement models based in performance that reward providers for quality outcomes, rather than those that reward services delivered. So patient engagement is an essential part for medical practices that want to establish themselves as a PCMH and improve their quality. ACOs measure patient engagement such as shared decision-making, health promotion and education, access to specialists, and physician communication. Therefore, the use of new technologies is a necessity.</p>

                            <li class="li-blog">Market Opportunity for Patient Engagement Solutions</li>
                            <p>High quality healthcare services are experiencing a rising demand, and this is having a direct impact in the market growth of patient engagement solutions. According to a recent <a href="http://www.transparencymarketresearch.com/sample/sample.php?flag=B&rep_id=4506" target="_blank">report</a>, this market is expected to expand at a compound annual growth rate of 23% during the period from 2015 to 2023. In 2014 the patient engagement solution market had a value of $6.6 Bn, so in 2023 this would reach a value of $34.94 Bn.</p>

                            <p>Quality and patient-centric healthcare services reforms implemented by the government have considerably increased the adoption of services with deeper patient engagement among healthcare payers and providers. Besides, the mass adoption of smartphones and tablets contributes to the growth of this relatively new market of patient engagement solutions.</p>
